Machine Intelligence Lab
===============================

Welcome to the documentation site for the Machine Intelligence Lab at the University of Florida, a robotics lab in Gainesville, Florida. Our lab has built `several robotic systems <https://mil.ufl.edu/projects/>`_ since its inception several decades ago. Our current projects include:

* **SubjuGator:** An autonomous, underwater submarine-like vehicle. Three-time champion of the AUSVI/ONR underwater competition. (`Website <https://subjugator.org>`_)
* **NaviGator:** An autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) which has competed in several maritime competitions. Won the 2016 Maritime RobotX Challenge, and received fourth in the 2018 Maritime RobotX Challenge. (`Website <https://subjugator.org>`_)
* **Virtual RobotX:** An new extension of the NaviGator project supporting virtual robotics.
